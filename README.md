To build a tic-tac-toe web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, you can create an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other or against an Al opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.

## Features
- **User Interaction**: Enter your name to start the game and track whose turn it is.
- **Gameplay**: Play against an AI opponent that makes moves based on simple random selection logic.
- **Win Conditions**: The game checks for winning combinations and announces the winner or declares a draw when no one wins.
- **Reset**: After a game ends, reset the board to start a new game.
